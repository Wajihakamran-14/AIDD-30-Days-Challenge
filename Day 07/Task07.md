## 🌐 What is SPECKit Plus?
SPECKit Plus is an AI-native development framework that helps teams build software in a clear, structured, and organized way. It breaks the development process into five simple phases, allowing you to define your idea, plan your system, assign tasks, and implement everything step-by-step. The goal is to make software development more predictable, collaborative, and AI-assisted.
It ensures every project starts with clarity and ends with a well-structured implementation.

# SPECKit Plus 5 Phases

## 1️⃣ /constitution
